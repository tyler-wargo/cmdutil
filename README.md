# cmdutil "Command Utility"

Python code example for a command-line utility that organizes files from a source directory to a destination directory based on file extensions. This script will handle various scenarios, including error handling and user-friendly messages.

In this script:

1. The script creates the destination directory and subdirectories based on file extensions.
2. It loops through the files in the source directory, identifies their file extensions, and moves them to the appropriate subdirectories in the destination directory.
3. Error handling is implemented to catch any exceptions that may occur during the organization process.
4. User-friendly messages are provided to indicate the progress and status of the organization process.

To use this script, save it to a .py file, and you can run it from the command line with the source and destination directory paths as arguments. (Example: python organize_files.py /path/to/source_directory /path/to/destination_directory)

Still a work-in-progress
